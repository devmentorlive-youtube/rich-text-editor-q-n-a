# Using Slate in React to build a QnA Component

If you enjoy my work or use my code or learn from me, please consider giving me a buck or two or five!

Your support helps me be able to spend more time making stuff for you, and of course, if you can't, it's no problem, the source code and videos are free, from me to you! Pay it forward some day!

A huge thank you for Netlify for hosting the demo to this lesson so it will always be available to you!
